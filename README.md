# Stock-Indices-Behavioural-Ananlysis

Conducted the correlation between Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500 with monthly data from June 2013 through June 2018. The result was quite interesting because the two Stock Indices are highly positively correlated with a value of 0.934. This result explains that the stocks in both the Indices are moving in the same direction. A highly positive correlation is not advantageous for the average investor because this correlation might have a huge impact during a bearish market.
